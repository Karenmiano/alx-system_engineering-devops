# 0x0D-web_stack_debugging_0

- First debugging project.

- Was given a docker container with Apache installed but not running and therefore could not serve pages.

- On my way had to research on Docker containerization and how it works from pulling images, creating containers from them and also accessing bash terminals inside containers.

- Containers have ports too and to access services from within them we  can map the port of a service to a free port on our computer.
